This is the top level of the ProTeXt distribution, an enhanced TeX
distribution for Windows, based on MiKTeX.

ProTeXt is distributed along with TeX Live, MacTeX and CTAN on a
DVD as the "TeX Collection".

For the TeX Collection, TeX Live is included in the subdirectory
texlive/, MacTeX in the subdirectory mactex/, and the CTAN
snapshot  in the subdirectory ctan/.  So if you want to use
these other distributions, first change to the appropriate directory.

The four distributions are entirely independent, each with its
own instructions and documentation.
